                    you and your buddies can draft players they think will preform the best in the league to their own team and compete against each other as if they
                    were a part of the action. Freinds can do prizes for winners and punishments for losers as all of it is done online allowing you, the fan, to enjoy the sport.

            <h3>My Background and Football's Impact</h3>
            <p class="border">My name is Parker Jenkins and ever since my best friend in kindergarten introduced me to the sport of football, I have been a diehard follower of all that happens in league. My friend's font-family
                is originally from Wisconsin, which means that they are Packers fans, and because I was always was at their house, I became one too. Though following one team was not enough for me as I wanted to keep track of all the teams while feeling emersed in the sport.

            </figure>
            <p class="border">Fantasy Football gives live updates as the games are happening all while also calculating the stats for the point system. The points work differently according to how each league sets them,
            but they follow the amount of yards a player is either able to gain on the run , or throw if they are a quarterback. Touchdowns give a lot of points
            to players though quarterbacks get a little less since they are normally throwing them in. However Qb's do not get credit if they hand the ball off for a run. Defenses gain points by positive plays for them but lose some if they are scored on and kickers only get points if they make it.

            <h3>Games starting from the beginning of the season to the End</h3>
            <p class="border"><em>The season begins around the month of September before the start of the actual League season, giving people time to prepare and get the best possible team assembled before
                Week 1. In a regular NFL season there are 17 weeks, which means for fantasy football, that there are 14 weeks and the last 3 are for playoffs.
                Every Wednesday players can try to pick up free agents, available players, if they had not already put in a bid for them.
                Each week officially ends after the last game is played that week, which is normally on a Monday. Players have to be aware of the different game times, in case they acciedentaly forget to make roster changes.
                Kickoff of a game makes it official and you can not move a player thats playing or played until the end of the week.

        An easy spot to be with your friends and watch multiple games are at places like sports bars and one that I go most often with my fantasy football friends
        is KickBack Jacks as the food is also great there. Another option is home as the Nfl provides a great channel that is specifically made for fantasy football lover called
        NFL Redzone which can show multiple games at a time and focuses on which ever game has more action at the time.

            </figure>
            <p class="border1">Fantasy Football gets a fan out of their comfort zone by not only following their favorite team. I used to only know 
             news happening to the Packers, but now I can follow all 32 teams as the game made it fun to learn about the rest of the teams. 
             It is a great way to bond with others who share your passion for football and since I've started fantasy football I still draft my favorite Packers players
             as there is nothing wrong with sticking to what you know.
            </p>
            <p class="border2">The best part is that you can be a part of multiple leagues, though be careful to not stretch yourself thin.
            It allows me to be a part of different friend groups, who live in different areas, and the chance to stay in touch with them as I do with my Highschool friends.
            Fantasy Football makes the game more interesting as now each game that is going on may mean more to you, as you may have a favorite player from your team playing at the moment.

                This past year I managed two fanatsy football teams, one with my family who used the Yahoo app, and another 
                with my friends who used the ESPN one. Both are very useful in their own ways, providing their own way to manage the game with their own statistics and graphics.
                Either way they all provide a fun service to enjoy the game for free with friends while also getting live game updates and news notifications of players you may have rostered.

                By using an if statment to determine if the index of the section is 0, the home page, it will make the rest of the displays none to not show.
                With query selector all, I was able to gather the "nav" and "a" elements in one variable , navLinks acting as and array to hold all the links. Then after using a for each loop and setting the parameters to be each link and their index,
                I used which ever link selected to have an event listener called when clicked to help display the right page.
